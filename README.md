# ECE8803_Final_Project
DRSS Severity Classification on OCT images

# Abstract

By looking at the visulization of a set of data, is it possible to predict the performance of models relative to each other to enable reliably choosing the best performing model?

## Initial Setup

Run the following commands to clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/gbotkin3/ECE8803_Final_Project.git
```

Add the PRIME_FULL folder from an unzipped OLIVES.zip to ./data_files

## Methodologies

  1. Linear Regressions
  2. GMM
  3. CNN
  4. DNN

## Performance Metrics
