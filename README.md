# ECE8803_Final_Project
DRSS Severity Classification on OCT images

# Abstract

By looking at the visulization of a set of data, is it possible to predict the performance of models relative to each other to enable reliably choosing the best performing model?

## Initial Setup

Run the following commands to clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/gbotkin3/ECE8803_Final_Project.git
```

Add the PRIME_FULL folder from an unzipped OLIVES.zip to ./data_files

## Visualization

  1. Scatter Map
  2. Pair Plot
  3. Heat Map

## Methodologies

  1. KNN
  2. Decision Tree
  2. GMM
  4. CNN

## Performance Metrics

  1. Accuracy
  2. AUROC Curve
  3. Precesions / Recall / F1
