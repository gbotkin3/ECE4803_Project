# ECE8803_Final_Project
DRSS Severity Classification on OCT images

# Abstract

By looking at the visulization of a set of data, is it possible to predict the performance of models relative to each other to enable reliably choosing the best performing model?

## Initial Setup

Run the following commands to clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/gbotkin3/ECE8803_Final_Project.git
```

Add the PRIME_FULL folder from an unzipped OLIVES.zip and PRIME.zip to ./data_files

## Required Dependencies

The following packages are required to run.

```
Numpy
PyTorch
Panda
PIL
SkLearn
Seaborn
Matplotlib
```

## Visualization Methods

  1. Scatter Map
  2. KDE Plot
  2. Pair Plot
  3. Heat Map

## Models

  1. KNN
  2. Decision Tree
  3. GMM (GausianNaiveBayes?)
  4. CNN ## TODO

## Performance Metrics

  1. Accuracy
  2. AUROC Curve ## TODO
  3. Precision, Recall, and F1 ## TODO
